# Web Tech Project

This is a student project by Susan O'Neil for the Certificate IV in IT (Programming)

The goal is to create a website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Tailwind, and involves the proper use of design principles and creating wireframes.

It will serve as a resume and portfolio of my work.
